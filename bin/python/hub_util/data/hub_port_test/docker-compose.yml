# docker-compose.yml configuration for a Stub stack that tests the ports used by the real traeffik stack.
#
#   This stack creates a simple whoami HTTP server on 5 ports (7080, 7443, 80, 443, and 8080). It is
#   used to test the ports used by the real traefik stack, to ensure that they are not already in use,
#   and that gateway router port forwarding is working correctly.
#
#   traefik must not be running when this stack is started, or it will fail to start.
