`tp-hub` is a project directory and collection of tools intended to make it easy to bootstrap a small container-based web-services hub
on an Ubuntu/Debian host machine. It is suitable for installation on Raspberry Pi or any dedicated 64-bit host that has ports 80, 443, 7080, and 7443 available for use.
The hub can manage multiple services sharing a single port and can expose individual services to the local intranet or to the public Internet. HTTPS termination is provided, including automatic provisioning of SSL certificates using [lets-encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) is used as a reverse-proxy, and [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/) is used to manage service [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) stacks.

Introduction
------------

`tp-hub` is a project directory and collection of tools intended to make it easy to bootstrap a small container-based web-services hub
on an Ubuntu/Debian host machine. It is suitable for installation on Raspberry Pi or any dedicated 64-bit host that has ports 80, 443, 7080, and 7443 available for use.

[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) is used as a reverse-proxy, and [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/) is used to manage service [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) service stacks.

All services, including Traefik and Portainer themselves, run in docker containers and are managed with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
 Individual service stacks can be easily configured to be visible to the LAN only, or to the public Internet.

A new web service can be added simply by authoring a docker-compose.yml file and using Portainer's web UI to add a managed stack. All reverse-proxy configuration settings for each service (including hostname/path routing, public/private entrypoints, etc.) are expressed with labels attached
to the service container and defined in its docker-compose.yml file, so there is never any need to edit reverse-proxy configuration as services are added, removed, and edited.

There are two primary docker-compose stacks that are directly configured and launched in the bootstrap process.:

  - [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) is used as a reverse-proxy and firewall for all services.
  It has the wonderful quality of automatically provisioning/deprovisioning reverse-proxy policy for
  services in docker containers when they are launched, modified, or stopped--based solely on configuration
  info attached to the container's docker labels. Once traefik is launched it generally never needs to be explicitly
  managed again. Traefik also automatically provisions private keys and SSL certificates (using lets-encrypt) for services as they
  are needed, and terminates HTTPS entrypoints so your service containers only need to implement HTTP.
  Traefik provides a web-based dashboard to view status and information related to the reverse-proxy.
  Traefik reverse-proxy has wide adoption, is open-source and free to use. 

  - [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/) is a nifty and very full-featured docker-compose service stack manager with a
  rich web UI to manage docker-compose stacks. With Portainer, you can add/remove/restart/reconfigure stacks, view logs, browse volumes,
  inspect resource usage, etc. Portainer includes a multiuser username/password database and full-featured access control
  if you need to allow multiple people to manage containers. Portainer Community Edition is open-source and free to use.
  The Portainer stack creates two containers--one for the main Portainer Web UI (Portainer itself), and another for the
  Portainer Agent--a backend service that allows Portainer to control Docker on the host machine. The two components
  are separated so that in complex environments, a single Portainer instance can manage Docker stacks on multiple host
  machines; for our purposes only one Portainer Agent is used and it is on the same host as Portainer itself

All of the containers in the two primary stacks are launched with `restart: always` so they will automatically be
restarted after host reboot or restart of the Docker daemon.

### Prerequisites

  - **Ubuntu/Debian**: The bootstrapping code provided here must be running an Ubuntu/Debian variant. The hub has only been tested
    on Ubuntu 22.04. However, if you skip auto-provisioning and manually install docker and docker-compose, the hub may well work
    on any Linux variant.
  - **Python 3.8+** is required by the bootstrapping scripts.
  - The ability to forward ports 80 and 443 on a public IP address to ports 7080 and 7443, respectively, on the
    tp-hub host. Generally, this means one of:
    - A gateway router or VPN that you manage and which supports port forwarding (with port remapping), and a way to make the
      tp-hub host have a fixed LAN IP address (either with a static IP address or via DHCP address reservation). This is the typical
      solution for home networks, and the one described here, but might not be possible in certain ISP environments (e.g., running behind a 5G hotspot, or when you do not manage the network you are running in). 
    - A port forwarding service or custom solution that provides an external public IP address and forwards ports 80 and 443 to a reverse tunneling agent running on the tp-hub host, which forwards connections to localhost ports 7080 and 7443, respectively. In this case, the public IP address used for outbound connections will be different than the public IP address used for inbound connections. Such a solution
    can be made to work without a stable LAN IP address or network public address, and without administrative control over the local network. It can even work when the tp-hub host machine is moved between multiple networks (i.e., a mobile tp-hub). An example of how to set up such a port-forwarding solution is described [here](stacks/sshtunnel).
      

Installation
=====

## Ensure your hub host has a static or reserved DHCP LAN IP address.
Because you will be enabling port forwarding for ports 80 and 443 on your Internet gateway router,
it is essential that the LAN IP address (hereon referred to as `${HUB_LAN_IP}`) of your hub host will never change. You can make that assurance
by either:

  1. using a static LAN IP address for your hub host; or
  2. configuring your DHCP server (generally built into your gateway router) to always provide the same IP address to your hub host (based on its MAC address). Note that with this method, you will have to reconfigure your DHCP server if you ever replace or upgrade your hub host.

## Configure port forwarding on your gateway router
Your network's gateway router must be configured to forward public TCP ports 80 and 443 to the hub host's stable
`${HUB_LAN_IP}` (see above) on alternate destination ports 7080 and 7443, respectively. Alternate internal ports are required because ports 80 and 443 on the hub host will be used to serve LAN-local (non-Internet) requests.

After this step is complete, there will be public, untrusted Internet traffic coming into your hub host on ports
7080 and 7443. It is important that those ports are not served by code that does not defend itself against malicious
visitors. The Traefik reverse proxy will handle requests coming into these ports and only route them to web services that
are explicitly configured to receive public Internet traffic.

## Register a public DNS Domain that you can administer
To serve requests to the Internet on well-known, easy-to-remember names, and to enable certificate generation for SSL/HTTPS, you must be able to create your own public DNS records that resolve to your network's public IP address. You
need to register or already have administrative access to a public domain we will call `${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}` (e.g., `smith-vacation-home.com`). You can use AWS Route53, Squarespace, GoDaddy or whatever registrar you like. If you use AWS Route53, this project provides
handy commands to easily create new DNS names within `${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`.`

## Provision a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) name for your network's gateway router public IP Address

Since typical residential ISPs may change your public IP address periodically, if you are running in a residential LAN, it is
usually necessary to involve Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to provide a stable name through which your
network's public IP address can be resolved. This requires running a DDNS agent inside the network
that periodically updates a public DNS server if the public IP address changes. Many gateway routers (e.g., eero) have a DDNS agent built-in. Or you can run a DDNS agent on this or another host inside your LAN. Your DDNS provider will provide you with an obscure but unique and stable (as long as you stay with the DDNS provider) DNS name `${DDNS_OBSCURE_NAME}` for your gateway's public IP address; e.g., "g1234567.eero.online".

### Duck DNS
If you do not already have a DDNS solution, this project includes a simple docker-compose stack that will run a DDNS agent for
[Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org/). Duck DNS is a completely free, reliable and reputable DDNS service hosted on AWS. Details on
how to deploy the Duck DNS agent for tp-hub are provided [here](stacks/duckdns).

### Networks without port forwarding
If your gateway router does not support support port forwarding, or you do not have administrative control of
your gateway route–e.g., if you are in a VPN or a corporate or academic LAN, are using a 5G Internet gateway, or are behind a 3rd-party
WiFi hotspot–then you will need an alternate solution to maintain a discoverable public IP address and forward
public ports 80 and 443 to tp-hub. One solution is to use ssh's reverse port tunneling capability in cooperation with a small
cloud host.  Details on how to make that work in tp-hub are provided [here](stacks/sshtunnel).

### Networks with static public IP addreses
If your network is behind a public IP address that will never change (e.g., an EC2 Elastic IP), then you can dispense with Dynamic DNS. Instead
just create an arbitrary DNS CNAME or A record that will always resolve to your network's ingress public IP Address. This DNS name
will be your `${DDNS_OBSCURE_NAME}` for the remainder of these instructions.

## Create a master CNAME record `ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}` that will always resolve to your public IP address
The first record you should create in your public domain is a CNAME record `ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}` that points to the
`${DDNS_OBSCURE_NAME}` given to you by your DDNS provider (see above). That makes an easy-to-remember DNS name for your
network's public IP address, and ensures that if your DDNS obscure name ever changes, you will only have to update this one
CNAME record to be back in business.

## Copy this project directory tree onto the hub host machine
A copy of this directory tree must be placed on the host machine. You can do this in several ways; for example:

 - If git is installed, you can directly clone it from GitHub:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git   # if necessary to install git first
   cd ~
   git clone --branch stable https://github.com/sammck/tp-hub.git
   cd tp-hub
   ```

- If you have SSH access to the host, you can copy the directory tree from another machine using rsync:
  ```bash
  # On other machine
  rsync -a tp-hub/ <my-username>@<my-hub-host>:~/tp-hub/
  ssh <my-username>@<my-hub-host>
  # On the hub
  cd tp-hub
  ```

## Run bin/hub-env to install the project's Python virtualenv and launch a bash shell in the project enviromnent:

There is a script `<project-dir>/bin/hub-env` which will activate the project environment including the Python
virtualenv that it uses. It can be invoked in one of 3 ways:

  - If sourced from another script or on the command line (bash '.' or 'source' command), it will directly modify
  environment variables, etc in the running process to activate the environment. This is similar to the way
  `. .venv/bin/activate` is typically used with Python virtualenv's.
  - If invoked as a command with arguments, the arguments are treated as a command to run within the environment.
  The command will be executed, and when it exits, control will be returned to the original caller, without
  modifying the original caller's environment.
  - If invoked as a command with no arguments, launches an interactive bash shell within the environment. When the
  shell exits, control is returned to the original caller, without modifying the original caller's environment.

Regardless of which way hub-env is invoked, if the virtualenv does not exist, hub-env will create it and initialize it with required
packages.  If necessary, hub-env will install system prerequisites needed to create the virtualenv, which might require
sudo. This is only done the first time hub-env is invoked.

In addition, hub-env tweaks the Python virtualenv's .venv/bin/activate to activate the entire tp-hub project rather than just the virtualenv.
This is a convenience primarily so that tools (like vscode) that understand how to activate a Python virtualenv will work properly
with the tp-hub project.

To initialize and activate the environment for the first time:

```bash
$ cd ~/tp-hub
$ bin/hub-env
...
# The first time you run bin/hub-env, there will be a lot of output as prerequisites are
# installed, the virtualenv is created, and required Python packages are installed. If
# necessary for prerequisite installation, you may be asked to enter your sudo password.
# If you don't wish to do this, you can CTRL-C out, install the prerequisite manually,
# and then restart this step.
# After the first time you run bin/hub-env, there will be no such spew or prompts.
...
Launching hub-env bash shell...
(hub-env) $
# You are now running a bash shell in the project environment, with all commands in the search PATH, etc.
```
> **Note**
> All of the instructions that follow assume you are running in a hub-env activated bash shell.


## Install prerequisite system packages

Docker and docker-compose must be installed, and the bootstrapping user must be in the `docker`
security group. A script is provided to automatically do this:

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
install-prereqs
```

This command is safe to run multiple times; it will only install what is missing.
If required, you will be prompted for your `sudo` password. If you don't wish to do this;
you can CRTL-C out, install the prerequisite manually, then restart this step.

> **Note**
> If you were not already in the `docker` security group when you started the current login session, you will
> be added, but the change will not take effect until you log out and log back in again. Until you do that,
> sudo will be required to run docker (you may be prompted for sudo password for each subsequent step that
> invokes docker).

## Create an initial config.yml file with minimal required configuration settings

A script `init-config` is provided that will create a boilerplate config.yml if needed,
and prompt you to provide values for required config settings. These include:

  - An email address to use for Lets-encrypt SSL certificate generation
  - An admin password to use for access to the Traefik dashboard web UI
  - An initial admin password to use for access to the Portainer web UI. Only used until the first time you set a new password.
  - The value of `${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}` that you set up as described above.

It is safe to run `init-config` multiple times; it will only prompt you for values that have not yet been
initialized.

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
init-config
# Answer the questions as prompted
```

## Verify that the initial configuration is valid

Just to make sure the initial configuration is readable and all values are sane, run this command to display
the resolved configuration:

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with './bin/hub-env'
hub config
# ...json configuration is displayed
```
## Create CNAME records for the initial set of services
On your DNS service, sreate the following CNAME records that are used by the initial configuration of the hub:

```
CNAME      traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com           ==> ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com    (Traefik dashboard UI; only exposed on LAN)
CNAME      portainer.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com         ==> ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com    (Portainer web UI; only exposed on LAN)
CNAME      hub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com               ==> ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com    (Shared general purpose public app DNS name)
CNAME      lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com            ==> ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com    (Shared general purpose lan-local app DNS name)
CNAME      whoami.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com            ==> ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com    (Used for initial example web service)
```
If you are using AWS route53, and have credentials configured in  `~/.aws/credentials`, you can use the following commands to create these records:

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with './bin/hub-env'
hub cloud dns create-name traefik
hub cloud dns create-name portainer
hub cloud dns create-name hub
hub cloud dns create-name lanhub
hub cloud dns create-name whoami
```

> **Note**
> Though an SSL cert is generated for the Traefik dashboard, and HTTPS can be used to access
> it through the local LAN entry point (with DNS override--see below), tp_hub does not expose the Traefik dashboard to the
> public Internet. It is not a good idea to expose the Traefik dashboard directly to the Internet;
> even though we authenticate it with HTTP basic authentication, it is read-only and it
> does not directly expose secrets, it reveals a lot
> of information about configuration that could make an attacker's job easier.

> **Note**
> Though an SSL cert is generated for the Portainer UI, and HTTPS can be used to access
> it through the local LAN entry point (with DNS override--see below), tp_hub does not expose the Portainer UI to the
> public Internet.
> Though thousands of users have done so, Portainer does not recommend exposing the Portainer
> UI directly to the Internet. It does have username/password authentication, multi-user support, and ACLs,
> so in theory it is OK. But placing it on the Internet exposes a bigger attack surface, and if Portainer is
> compromised then the attacker can launch any docker container (even privileged containers) and easily root
> the hub-host, and from there attempt to attack other hosts inside your LAN.

## Test the physical network configuration

Before launching the hub stacks for the first time, it is important to ensure that the network has been properly
set up in the previous steps. This includes:

  - All above mentioned DNS CNAME entries are created and point to this network's public IP address
  - Port forwarding from public port 80 to this host port 7080 is working
  - Port forwarding from public port 443 to this host port 7443 is working
  - Ports 80, 443, 7080, 7443, 8080, and 9000 are available for use on this host

You can test all of these assumptions with `test-network-prereqs`

> **Note**
> The `test-network-prereqs` script requires that the traefik and portainer stacks are not running, or tests will fail.

The environment variables and other customizable configuration elements used by docker-compose
to launch the Traefik and Portainer docker-compose stacks are derived from the hub configuration
you set up in previous steps. To prepare these derived files for use by docker-compose, run the following command:

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
test-network-prereqs
```
## Override public DNS for LAN-local HTTPS names (Optional)
 Any services that can be accessed through HTTPS but require a local LAN connection (including `traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`,
`portainer.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`, and `lanhub.{PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`) present a special problem.

On the one hand, in order to generate valid Let's-encrypt certificates for them, they must have a valid public DNS name that resolves
to your network's public IP address--this is necessary so that Traefik can answer Let's-encrypt's HTTP challenge, which is the way Let's-encrypt
verifies that you own the DNS name you are requesting a certificate for.

On the other hand, for your client (web browser, etc) that is sitting within the LAN, you want the service's DNS name to resolve to the tp-hub host's
LAN-local IP address `${HUB_LAN_IP}`. That way it will enter the reverse-proxy through the LAN-local entry point and will be allowed through the firewall.

The most correct way to make that work would be to run an intermediate DNS server inside your LAN that overrides the necessary public IP
addresses and point all machines on the LAN at that DNS server (via DHCP configuration, etc). But that is overkill for most home environments.

A simpler solution is to edit `/etc/hosts` (or `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) on each LAN-based client
that will access the hub, and add the line:
```
${HUB_LAN_IP} portainer.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN} traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN} lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}
```

After that, both http and https should work for these DNS names, on so-edited clients, within the LAN.

This is an optional step--if you are willing to forego HTTPS, then from within your LAN you can access services through an alternate HTTP-only LAN-local URL:

| Service | HTTP/HTTPS URLs requiring DNS override | HTTP-only LAN-local URL | 
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| **Traefik Dashboard** | `http://traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`<br>`https://traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}` | `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}:8080` |
| **Portainer UI** | `http://portainer.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`<br>`https://portainer.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}` | `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}:9000` |
| **Shared LAN-local services** | `http://lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/<appname>`<br>`https://lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/<appname>` | `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}/<appname>` |

## Build the traefik and portainer docker-compose configuration files

The environment variables and other customizable configuration elements used by docker-compose
to launch the Traefik and Portainer docker-compose stacks are derived from the tp-hub configuration
you set up in previous steps. To prepare these derived files for use by docker-compose, run the following command:

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
hub build
```
> **Note**
> If you ever change the settings in `config.yml``, either directly or through `hub config set`, you
> should rebuild the stack configurations with `hub build`.

## Launch Traefik reverse-proxy

Next, start the Traefik reverse-proxy. To perform this step, the user must be in the `docker` security group.

> **Note**
> If you were not already in the `docker` security group when you started the current login session, you were
> added by `install-prereqs.sh`, but the change will not take effect until you log out and log back in again.
> Until you do that, you will be prompted for your sudo password when invoking commands that require docker.

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
hub traefik up
```

Traefik will immediately begin serving requests on ports 80 and 443 on both the local hub-host and on the public
Internet. It will also obtain a lets-encrypt SSL certificate for `traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}``.
However, no proxied services are yet exposed to the Internet, so requests to the public addresses will
always receive `404 page not found` regardless of host name.

## Verify basic Traefik functionality

Make a cursory check to see that everything thinks it is running by examining the logs

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
hub traefik logs | grep error
```

Verify that the Traefik Dashboard is functioning by opening a web browser on the hub-host or any other
host in the LAN and navigating to `http://${HUB_LAN_IP}:8080`, where `${HUB_LAN_IP}` is the stable LAN
IP address of your hub-host, as described above.

You will be prompted for login credentials.  The username is "admin" and the password is the one you entered
for the Traefik dashboard in the above steps.

Verify that Traefik is serving LAN-local HTTP requests (from any host in the LAN):
```bash
curl http://${HUB_LAN_IP}
# you will receive 404 page not found, which is expected
```

Verify that Traefik is serving LAN-local HTTPS requests (from any host in the LAN) with a valid certificate:
```bash
curl --resolve traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}:443:${HUB_LAN_IP} https://traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}
# you will receive 401 Unauthorized, which is expected (dashboard is behind HTTP Basic Authentication)
```

Verify that port forwarding from 80 to 7080 is working and Traefik is serving public Internet HTTP requests (from any host with Internet access):
```bash
curl http://traefik.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}
# you will receive "Found" due to a 302 redirect to HTTPS, which is expected
```

## Launch Portainer

Next, start the Portainer stack. To perform this step, the user must be in the `docker` security group.

> **Note**
> If you were not already in the `docker` security group when you started the current login session, you were
> added by `install-prereqs.sh`, but the change will not take effect until you log out and log back in again.
> Until you do that, you will be prompted for your sudo password when invoking commands that require docker.

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
hub portainer up
```

Portainer will immediately be recognized by Traefik and Traefik will begin reverse-proxying requests to it.

## Verify basic Portainer functionality

Make a cursory check to see that everything thinks it is running by examining the logs

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with '~/tp-hub/bin/hub-env'
hub portainer logs | grep ERR
```

Verify that the Portainer Web UI is functioning by opening a web browser on the hub-host or any other
host in the LAN and navigating to `http://${HUB_LAN_IP}:9000`, where `${HUB_LAN_IP}` is the stable LAN
IP address of your hub-host, as described above.

You will be prompted for login credentials.  The username is "admin" and the password is the one you entered
for the Portainer Web UI in the above steps.

Verify that Portainer is serving LAN-local HTTPS requests (from any host in the LAN) with a valid certificate:
```bash
curl --resolve portainer.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}:443:${HUB_LAN_IP} https://portainer.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}
# you will receive A bunch of HTML for the Portainer home page (not logged in)
```

## Done!
Congratulations, your `tp-hub` is up and running! Both the Traefik and Portainer stack containers were launched with `restart=always`, so they
will automatically restart when Docker is restarted or your hub host reboots. From here on, you can manage all of your web service stacks through
the Portainer UI, which you can browse to (from any client inside the LAN) at `http://${HUB_LAN_IP}:9000`. If your client can discover
the hub host via Bonjour or mDNS, then you can use `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}:9000`  or `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}.local:9000`.

Proceed to the next section to deploy your first example web service.

Adding an example "whoami" web service
=====

In this section, you will deploy a simple web service `whoami`. It simply accepts HTTP get requests and responds to them with plain text
describing all of the received HTTP headers, the URL path, Traefik route, etc. It will be configured to serve multiple entry points:

  - `http://whoami.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`            (both on private LAN and public Internet)
  - `https://whoami.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`           (both on private LAN and public Internet)
  - `http://hub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`        (both on private LAN and public internet)
  - `https://hub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`       (both on private LAN and public internet)
  - `http://lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`     (Private LAN only, requires DNS override--see above)
  - `https://lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`    (Private LAN only, requires DNS override--see above)
  - `http://${HUB_LAN_IP}/whoami`                   (Private LAN only)
  - `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}/whoami`                 (Private LAN only)
  - `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}.local/whoami`           (Private LAN only) (for Mac clients)
  - `http://localhost/whoami`                       (Hub host only only) (for clients on hub host itself)
  - `http://127.0.0.1/whoami`                       (Hub host only only) (for clients on hub host itself)

## Make sure any new DNS names your stack will serve have been created
If your stack will run on a DNS name not used by an existing stack, then you need to create a new DNS name *before* deploying the
stack. In the case of this example, it will serve on `whoami.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`. We already created that record while we
were setting up the other records for Traefik and Portainer. However, for many new stacks you will have to create new DNS records; e.g.,

```
CNAME      whoami.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com            ==> ddns.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}.com
```
If you are using AWS route53, and have credentials configured in  `~/.aws/credentials`, you can use the following commands to create these records:

```bash
# if not running in hub-env shell, launch with './bin/hub-env'
hub cloud dns create-name whoami
```

## Grab the docker-compose.yml for the example service
The only file necessary to install this stack is the docker-compose.yml file in this project at `~/tp-hub/examples/whoami/docker-compose.yml`.

The easiest way to install it into Portainer is to copy it into the clipboard of the browser client on the private LAN that you will be using to
access Portainer.  Do that in whatever way is easiest for you. E.g., you can browse to https://github.com/sammck/tp-hub/blob/main/examples/whoami/docker-compose.yml and copy it into the clipboard from there.

> **Note:**
> For more sophisticated stacks Portainer is also able to clone a named github repo and run a docker-compose stack in it.

## Log into Portainer

On a web browser in the private LAN, navigate to `http://${HUB_LAN_IP}:9000`, `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}:9000`,  or `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}.local:9000`
as described above.

If prompted, log into Portainer with username 'admin' and the Portainer password you configured during setup.

## Navigate to the Portainer "stacks" page

From the Portainer Home page, click on the big box labeled "${HUB_HOSTNAME} portainer agent". This will move you into the Environment page
for the hub host (Portainer is capable of managing multiple Docker host machines, but tp-hub is set up to only manage a single Environment
on the same host that Portainer runs on).

Click on the box that says "Stacks". This will take to to the Page that lists all of the docker-compose stacks that exist on
your hub.  Two of the stacks--"traefik" and "portainer", were the stacks that we created directly outside of Portainer; they run Traefik
and Portainer themselves. Because they were created outside of Portainer, they are marked as Limited Control. You should not need to
mess with them ever from within Portainer.

Any stacks listed with Total Control are those you created with Portainer. If this is your first time using Portainer, there should not
be any such stacks listed.

## Create a new stack
Click on the button labelled "+ Add Stack".  This will take you to the "Create stack" page.

Give your stack the name "whoami". This is the name you will see in the listed stacks page, and it also becomes the project
name for docker-compose; it is used as a prefix for created docker container names, etc.

We are going to directly paste in docker-compose.yml content, so click on "Web editor".

Click inside the Web editor textbox and paste the content of the whoami example docker-compose.yml file.

Note: below the textbox, you may wish to click on "+ Add an Environment Variable" to define docker-compose environment variables that
will be expanded when the docker-compose.yml file is interpreted. However, for this example, most of the appropriate
variables have been injected into the Portainer runtime environment by tp-hub, so this stack will run perfectly without defining
any additional values.

Finally, click on "Deploy the stack". Within a few seconds it will be up and running and actively serving requests. You
will be taken to the "Stack details" page, where you can inspect the containers within the stack, view logs, resource usage
graphs, and even open a Web-UI terminal into any container.

## Use your new web service

In a browser on any host with Internet access, navigate to one of:

  - `http://whoami.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`            (both on private LAN and public Internet)
  - `https://whoami.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}`           (both on private LAN and public Internet)
  - `http://hub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`        (both on private LAN and public internet)
  - `https://hub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`       (both on private LAN and public internet)

In a browser on any host inside the private LAN, navigate to:

  - `http://lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`     (Private LAN only, requires DNS override--see above)
  - `https://lanhub.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}/whoami`    (Private LAN only, requires DNS override--see above)
  - `http://${HUB_LAN_IP}/whoami`                   (Private LAN only)
  - `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}/whoami`                 (Private LAN only)
  - `http://${HUB_HOSTNAME}.local/whoami`           (Private LAN only) (for Mac clients)

Congratulations! You've just deployed a tp-hub web service stack and used it from the Internet and your private LAN, with valid HTTPS certificates.

Since the docker-compose service in your `whoami` stack was defined with `restart: always`, it will automatically restart when Docker is restarted
or the hub host is rebooted.

If you wish to remove the stack, you can click on the "Delete this stack" button in the "Stack details" page. Traefik will
automatically detect the removal of containers and remove the reverse-proxy routes associated with them.
