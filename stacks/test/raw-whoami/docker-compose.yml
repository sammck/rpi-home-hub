# docker-compose.yml configuration for a simple HTTP service container
# that sits behind traefik and returns harmless information about the HTTP request. Useful
# for debugging connectivity and Traefik configuration issues.
#
# WARNING: This stack exposes all HTTP client headers to any client that can access it. This
#          includes cookies marked 'httpOnly' as well as headers added by reverse proxies
#          before being forwarded to this service. In notrivial configurations it may pose
#          a security risk. For example, JavaScript running in a browser in the same
#          site domain will be able to read its httpOnly cookies, which can create a
#          cross-site scripting attack risk even if this service is behind authentication.
#          Do not use this stack in a production environment without careful consideration .
