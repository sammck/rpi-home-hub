# docker-compose.yml configuration for a Traefik reverse-proxy with dashboard.
#
#  Environment Variables:
#    DEFAULT_CERT_RESOLVER   "prod" or "staging".  The default certificate resolver to use for
#                                 https services that do not specify a resolver.
#                                 "prod" uses real lets-encrypt certificates, "staging" uses staging lets-encrypt
#    TRAEFIK_CERT_RESOLVER   "prod" or "staging".  The certificate resolver to use for ${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME}
#                                 "prod" uses real lets-encrypt certificates, "staging" uses staging lets-encrypt
#    TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME        The fully qualified public DNS domain that the traefik dashboard will run on.
#                            There must be a DNS entry for this name that resolves to this network's public IP address.
#    LETSENCRYPT_OWNER_EMAIL_PROD
#                            The email address to associate with production-issued lets-encrypt certificataes
#    LETSENCRYPT_OWNER_EMAIL_STAGING
#                            The email address to associate with production-issued lets-encrypt certificataes
#    TRAEFIK_HTPASSWD         A comma-delimited list of username/hashed password values in the format
#                                 generated by `htpasswd`. The usernames and associated passwords in this
#                                 list will be able to access the Traefik dashboard.
#    TRAEFIK_LOG_LEVEL       The log level for traefik.  One of "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "FATAL", "PANIC"

# Entrypoints:
#    This stack creates a Traefik reverse-proxy with 5 entrypoints:
#
#    Entrypoint      Port   Description
#    ----------      ----   ---------------------------------
#    web             7080   Intended to serve public HTTP requests; public port 80 on the network's gateway
#                             router should be port-forwarded to this port. Also used to serve challenge
#                             requests from lets-encrypt to verify ownership of domain names.
#    websecure       7443   Intended to serve public HTTPS requests; public port 443 on the network's gateway
#                             router should be port-forwarded to this port.
#    lanweb            80   Serves HTTP requests for LAN-local clients
#    lanwebsecure     443   Serves HTTPS requests for LAN-local clients. to be used without certificate errors,
#                             A public DNS name must resolve externally to this network's public IP address,
#                             but must resolve within the LAN to this host's LAN IP address. This can be done
#                             by putting the LAN IP address in each client's /etc/hosts, or by hosting
#                             a LAN-local DNS server that overrides the public entries.
#    landashboard    8080   Serves the traefik dashboard on LAN-local http://<any-hostname>:8080.  Requires HTTP basic authentication.
#
# Externally, this stack serves:
#    http://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME}                      Dashboard (private LAN only)
#    https://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME}                     Dashboard (private LAN only)
#    http://<any-hostname>/traefik                   Dashboard (private LAN only)
#
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Prerequisites common to all stacks (only done once when traefik is initially set up):
#     * A DNS entry with a stable name (e.g., ddns.<parent-dns-domain>) has been configured to resolve to the current public IP address
#       of your network's gateway router. Since typical residential ISPs may change your public IP address periodically, it is
#       usually necessary to involve Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to make this work. Some gateway routers (e.g., eero) have DDNS support built-in.
#       Your DDNS provider will provide you with an obscure but unique and stable (as long as you stay with the DDNS provider)
#       DNS name for your gateway's public IP address; e.g., "g1234567.eero.online". You should then create a CNAME entry for
#       ddns.<parent-dns-domain> that points at the obscure DDNS name. That makes an easy-to-remember DNS name for your network's public IP
#       address, and ensures that if your DDNS obscure name ever changes, you will only have to update this one CNAME record
#       to be back in business.  
#     * A DNS CNAME entry has been created for ${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME} that resolves to ddns.<parent-dns-domain> (see above)
#       You must create a DNS entry for ${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME} that resolves to your gateway router's public IP address
#       *before* starting this stack. If you do not, lets-encrypt will be unable to validate the certificate request,
#       and will eventually throttle you for a week at a time.
#     * Your network's gateway router must be configured to forward public ports 80 and 443 to this host on alternate destination ports
#       ports, as 80->7080 and 443->7443. Alternate ports are required because ports 80 and 443 on this host are used to serve
#       LAN-local (non-nternet) requests and must not be exposed to the internet. This must be done *before* starting this stack.
#       If you do not, lets-encrypt will be unable to validate the certificate request, and will eventually throttle you for a
#       week at a time.
#     * A persistent docker network "traefik" has been created before launching. This network is used by traefik to proxy requests to
#       backend service containers
#     * A persistent docker volume "traefik_acme" has been created before launching. This volume will contain cached issued
#       certificates from lets-encrypt it is very important that this data is not deleted and survives rebuild/restart
#       of traefik; lets-encrypt will block you for a period of time if you request reissuance of certificates that are not due for renewal.
services:
  traefik:
    # The traefik reverse proxy (includiong dashboard).
    #
    #  Configured to:
    #
    #    Use docker network "traefik" for backend connections to services behind the reverse-proxy
    #    Use lets-encrypt to automatically issue and renew SSL certificates. Persistence of lets-encrypt
    #      certificate state is kept in docker volume "traefik_acme", which should never be deleted.
    #    Serve public http:// on port 7080 (entrypoint "web").  This is port-forwarded to this host from my home's public IP
    #      address (on port 80) via eero port forwarding. This port is also used by lets-encrypt to verify that I have ownership of
    #      the server behind a DNS name when a new SSL certificate is issued.
    #    Serve public https:// on port 7443 (entrypoint "websecure"). This is port-forwarded to this host from my home's public IP
    #      address (on port 443) via eero port forwarding. Each hostname routed to this entrypoint is included in the SSL certificate(s) created
    #      by lets-encrypt. The Host rule's hostname MUST have a record in DNS that resolves to my home's public IP address before
    #      a valid SSL certificate can be created.
    #    Serve private (internal LAN only) http:// on port 80 (entrypoint "lanweb"). This port should NOT be exposed to the internet 
    #    Serve private (internal LAN only) https:// on port 443 (entrypoint "lansecureweb"). A self-signed certificate
    #      is used (not a valid certificate). This port should NOT be exposed to the internet.
    #    Serve a password-authenticated Traefik dashboard on http://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME}, https://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME},
    #      and "http://<any-hostname>/traefik", all for internal LAN only.
