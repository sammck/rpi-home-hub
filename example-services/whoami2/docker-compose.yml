# docker-compose.yml configuration for a simple HTTP service container
# that sits behind traefik and returns harmless information about the HTTP request. Useful
# for debugging connectivity and traefik configuration issues.
#
#  Environment Variables:
#    DNS_DOMAIN          A registered public DNS domain that you control; e.g., "obama-family-home.com"
#
# This stack serves:
#    http://whoami2.${DNS_DOMAIN}            (public internet or private LAN)
#    https://whoami2.${DNS_DOMAIN}           (public internet or local LAN)
#    http://<any-hostname>/whoami2           (private LAN only)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Prerequisites common to all stacks (only done once when traefik is initially set up):
#     * A DNS entry with a stable name (e.g., home.${DNS_DOMAIN}) has been configured to resolve to the current public IP address
#       of your network's gateway router. Since typical residential ISPs may change your public IP address periodically, it is
#       usually necessary to involve Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to make this work. Some gateway routers (e.g., eero) have DDNS support built-in.
#       Your DDNS provider will provide you with an obscure but unique and stable (as long as you stay with the DDNS provider)
#       DNS name for your gateway's public IP address; e.g., "g1234567.eero.online". You should then create a CNAME entry for
#       home.{DNS_DOMAIN} that points at the obscure DDNS name. That makes an easy-to-remember DNS name for your network's public IP
#       address, and ensures that if your DDNS obscure name ever changes, you will only have to update this one CNAME record
#       to be back in business.  
#     * Your network's gateway router must be configured to forward public ports 80 and 443 to traefik on alternate destination ports
#       (e.g., 80->7080, 443->7443). Alternate ports are required because ports 80 and 443 are used to serve lan-local (non-internet)
#       requests and must not be exposed to the internet.
#     * traefik should be configured with entrypoints as follows:
#            web            HTTP requests coming in from the public internet through <your-home-public-ip-address>:80
#            websecure      HTTPS requests coming in from the public internet through <your-home-public-ip-address>:443
#            lanweb         HTTP reguests coming in from the intranet through <this-host-lan-ip>:80. Not reachable from internet.
#            lanwebsecure   HTTPS reguests coming in from the intranet through <this-host-lan-ip>:443. Not reachable from internet.
#     * traefik should be configured to proxy requests to backend service containers through docker network "traefik"
#
#  Special prerequisites for this stack.
#     * A DNS CNAME entry has been created for whoami2.${DNS_DOMAIN} that resolves to home.${DNS_DOMAIN} (see above)
#       You must create a DNS entry for whoami2.${DNS_DOMAIN} that resolves to your gateway router's public IP address
#       *before* starting this stack. If you do not, lets-encrypt will be unable to validate the certificate request,
#       and will eventually throttle you for a week at a time.

networks:

  # The backend docker network used for traefik reverse-proxy request forwarding. All containers
  # that provide HTTP services behind the traefik reverse-proxy should be placed in
  # this network. traefik will route to the service on its exposed port, if there is exactly one, or port
  # 80 by default.  This can be overridden with:
  #
  #    traefik.http.services.<service-name>.loadbalancer.server.port=<custom-port>
  #
  # It is not necessary for containers behind the reverse-proxy to expose their HTTP port to the host.
